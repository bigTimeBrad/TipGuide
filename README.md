International Tipping guide is a mobile application built in Android Studio by students in the Application Development Program at North Seattle College. The purpose of this app is to provide users with information on tipping standards, based off what country they are visiting and what service they are recieving(example: restaurants, hotel, taxi cab,tour guide). We built a NoSQL database using Firebase by google, that provides tipping standard information for 50 different popular countries that people like to travel too. The app is split into 3 different fragments(tabs). The first fragment allows the user to choose a country from our dropdown list. The app will then display tipping standard information for the chosen country. The second fragment is a currency converter, and the third is a tip calculator.  

Developed by Jeremiah Smith, Zoila Pe√±a, Melanie Shaffer, and Brad Nissen.
